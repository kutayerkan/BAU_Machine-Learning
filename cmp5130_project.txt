vi) Project Content

In the project report, you should:

- Choose one or more datasets from Kaggle, UCI machine learning repository or any other internet source. You are also allowed to use a dataset belonging to the company or organization you work for if you have the required permissions.

- Clearly define the aim of the project. You may use the methods we have covered until now this semester or any other machine learning method. 

- Give a review of the related works about your project topics.

- Briefly summarize the methods you have implemented in your project with your own words. 

- Give the experimental results with tables and/or figures. Make comments and compare the algorithms with proper evaluation metrics depending on the structure of your problem and dataset.
